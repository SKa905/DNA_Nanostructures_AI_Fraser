TO USE the pyDAEDALUS program:

- There are two parts: 
  1) A "back-engine" program that does all the actual work. It is located in
     pyDAEDALUS/pyDAEDALUS/DAEDserve.py --> note that this is a python file.
     
     YOU MUST RUN THIS PROGRAM FIRST USING python _____ (run this in the folder
     you want the outputs to be in) --> this will create a server that can 
     then be accessed

  2) An index.html --> Must be accessed thru your File Explorer, in the 
     pyDAEDALUS/pyDAEDALUS/ folder. This is the GUI interface for the program,
     where you will submit all your actual info. Then it'll communicate to the
     running DAEDserve.py server (which should already be running in your
     WSL terminal) and make some outputs for you in your current directory.

- Alternatively you can have a python file run instead of putting things in the index.html 
  GUI, but either way you have to have the DAEDserve.py program running.
